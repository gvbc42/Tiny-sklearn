# tiny-sklearn

- Tiny implementation of important algorithms in scikit-learn
(e.g., pure python, no input validation, no speed/memory optimization, do not support sparse matrix and multioutput).
- Useful when understanding ML algorithms and scikit-learn.
- Multiple implementations of each algorithm.
- Roughly follow the structure of scikit-learn.
- Roughly follow the API standard of scikit-learn.
- Results are compared with scikit-learn.
- Under construction.
